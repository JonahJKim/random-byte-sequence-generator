Procedure:
- Open tarball, clone, put source code in
- Create notes.txt ($touch notes.txt)
- Read Makefile and randall.c
- Add make check by printing out and counting number of lines
- Split program into sections (everything is before the main section, so easy to locate)
- Get rid of additional header files that I don't need (copy and pasted before)
- Modify Makefile to accomodate new files
- Add options using getopt (research)
- Start with input option by creating a struct "options" with all the information regarding options like input/output source
- Proceed to output options
- Finish all the options and proceed to buffer
- Add buffer for N
- Git add, commit, push to GitHub repo
